# conway
Simple implementation of Conway's Game of Life in Processing

<p>On launch, this application generates a randomized grid of active and inactive cells. Each frame after, cells activate and deactivate according the following rules:</p>
<p>
<br/>1. Any active cells with two or three active cells touching it will stay active.
<br/>2. Any inactive cells with exactly three active cells touching it will become active.
<br/>3. All other cells become/remain inactive.
